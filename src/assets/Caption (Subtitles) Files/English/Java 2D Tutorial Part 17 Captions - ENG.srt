00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,480
hi guys this is rice know

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,360
last time we implemented npg dials

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,519
so now we can talk to them

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,639
and we also implemented font files

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
and

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,119
instantiated them in our program so the

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,960
correct fonts will be used even after

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,680
exporting our game as a jar file

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,960
at the end of the last video i said we

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,480
were going to implement player life and

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,600
event class

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,719
but sorry there was a slight change of

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
runs

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
apparently some of you guys are tackling

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
the

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,879
known gameplay screen such as title

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,320
screen or character creation screen

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,199
and wondering how to implement them

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,920
so

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,600
in this video we will create a title

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,920
screen

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
and nothing fancy it's a really simple

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
title screen

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,320
but anyway let's start

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,600
first we create a new game state

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,560
so

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,000
public final hint

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
title state

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,680
and i'm gonna use zero

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
and then

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
we edit

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,119
this paint component a little bit

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,640
so since we don't need to draw

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,680
this background tiles or

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,200
npcs or other entities on the title

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:42,079
screen so we add some conditions and

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
specify what to draw and what not

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,360
title

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
screen

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,640
if

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
game state

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,640
equal

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,640
title state

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
and for now

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
others

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,680
so

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
else

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,040
and we're gonna move

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,319
everything

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
pairs

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:16,879
into this l sprocket

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,160
also let's change the default game state

53
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,680
to this one

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
to the

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,239
title state

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,239
so it starts from this state

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,720
okay let's check

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,840
so nothing shows up

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
since you know

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,920
we have bypassed old drawings

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,000
so we can still hear the music though

62
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,239
and

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,160
i don't want to play this music in this

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,360
title screen so

65
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,400
yeah let's disable this for now

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
okay then let's draw this

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,319
title screen

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,519
in this title state we only call

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,400
ui

70
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,560
draw method

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
but then go to this

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,120
ui class

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,760
and okay

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,319
so here at another

75
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
condition

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
title

77
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,000
state

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:34,159
so gp.game state

79
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,519
all gp dot title

80
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,519
to

81
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,519
state

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,200
and like others

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,040
we call a method so draw

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
title screen

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,680
or something

86
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
and we're gonna create this method

87
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
so

88
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,720
yeah maybe here

89
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,840
public void

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
draw title screen

91
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,519
okay then first let's display the game

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,319
title around here

93
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,480
the title name

94
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,360
and i want to use

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,880
kind of large font so

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,880
let's change the font size

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,400
select font

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,400
and also use bold

99
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
96

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,320
and then

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
string

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
text

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,120
equal

104
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
the game title

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,919
game title is

106
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,919
blue boy

107
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,919
adventure

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,400
and then we gonna set x and y

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
and x is

110
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,479
so

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,479
we have created

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,600
this method before so we can use this

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,880
so we can get the x

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,720
with

115
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,960
equal

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,960
text

117
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,240
and why is

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
something like uh

119
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
yeah plus

120
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,960
three tiles or something

121
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,120
gp dot tile size

122
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,720
time three

123
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,800
and now we

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,199
set the color

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,199
color

126
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,840
white

127
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,320
and the draw

128
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,240
string string

129
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,240
text and x on the y

130
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
okay let's check

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,160
yeah like this

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,199
i'm using the current black background

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
color

134
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,360
but if you want to set a different color

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
then

136
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,600
you can do that by typing like this

137
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,600
so for set color

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,319
any color is fine like yeah you can use

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,560
rgb number like

140
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,039
70

141
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,840
120

142
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
ad or something

143
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
and then

144
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,560
draw

145
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,520
rectangle or

146
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
fill rectangle

147
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,319
and x 0 y 0 and

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,319
screen with

149
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,960
screen height

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
like this

151
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,840
then

152
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,680
yeah

153
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,680
you know you can change the background

154
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
color like this

155
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,280
so we have displayed this title name but

156
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,520
this looks kind of generic so now

157
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
we're gonna add a little shadow to this

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,919
text

159
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
so this

160
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:11,280
is main color

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,440
and so before drawing this main text

162
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,240
shadow

163
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:21,759
so we first we set color shadow color

164
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,520
so let's use black

165
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,120
and then

166
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,120
we draw the same text

167
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,199
text x1 x and y

168
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,440
but the slide three move

169
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:41,360
to the right hand to the bottom

170
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,880
like plus five and plus five

171
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
okay let's check

172
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,319
yep

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,360
like this

174
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,680
so now the text has a shadow and it

175
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,039
looks a bit more

176
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,759
i don't know how to say 3d i guess

177
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,120
but i actually like the original black

178
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,440
background color better than this so

179
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,639
i'm gonna change

180
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
to

181
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,120
black

182
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,400
and change this shadow color

183
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,400
to gray

184
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,720
yeah like this

185
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,759
very simple but i like it

186
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,280
okay now let's display an image

187
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,800
so i want to display the

188
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,120
player blue boy image around here

189
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,599
a blue boy

190
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
image

191
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,680
so first x is

192
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,240
so somewhere in the middle so

193
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,240
for now

194
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,480
and let's divide this screen width

195
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,959
by two

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,440
and y is y

197
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,440
plus

198
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
two tiles or something

199
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,080
so we add two tiles from this y so from

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,279
text y

201
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,720
and then we're gonna draw image so g2

202
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,240
dot draw

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,880
image

204
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,720
and the image is

205
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,800
gp.player dot

206
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
down one

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,200
and okay

208
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,720
x is x

209
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,240
y and which is

210
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
g p dot

211
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
tiles

212
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
size times

213
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,880
so

214
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,360
96 pixels please

215
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,000
tie the size

216
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
times 2

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,839
or something

218
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
yeah let's check

219
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
and we want to adjust the position a

220
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
little bit so

221
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
a little to the left

222
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,640
so since we are displaying

223
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,560
the character with this size so so this

224
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
is the center point

225
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,320
so

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,000
we're going to subtract

227
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
so this sprite size

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,240
divide it by two

229
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,880
so this should place the character at

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
the center

231
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,839
okay

232
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,839
yeah so basically you can type any

233
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:34,160
number here like

234
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,800
100 or 200 or any number but

235
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,839
i'd recommend you to choose a number

236
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,440
that can be divided by the

237
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,720
original tile size which is 16

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,600
16 pixels so otherwise sometimes

239
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
the

240
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,200
sprite becomes kind of a distorted and

241
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,079
look a bit ugly so

242
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
okay now let's display some

243
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,519
menu

244
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
so around here

245
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,680
menu

246
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,680
and first let's change the font size

247
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,480
yeah like a half size

248
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,480
48

249
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
a

250
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,560
new game

251
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:25,360
and x is this one so we can copy this

252
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,959
x

253
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,000
and y

254
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,920
so we're gonna add

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,680
one two three

256
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,920
maybe four tiles

257
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,600
from this image

258
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,839
so gp dot tyres size

259
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
times

260
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,880
four and then

261
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
draw string

262
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,279
g2

263
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,279
draw string

264
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
text x and y

265
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,120
and ok let's copy this and

266
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,279
paste

267
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,720
the paste

268
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,680
and the second option is

269
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,200
load

270
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,519
game

271
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,959
and the third one is squid

272
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,560
so let's change this to

273
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,839
one tile and one tile

274
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
yup something like this

275
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,760
okay

276
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,000
ah

277
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,320
maybe a bit higher

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
maybe

279
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,040
3.5

280
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,440
okay and now we want to select

281
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,839
one of these options

282
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,839
all right first we create an integer

283
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,320
public hint

284
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,880
command

285
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,839
number command num

286
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,760
and the default is zero

287
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,480
and then

288
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,839
after drawing this new game

289
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
we add the if statement

290
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,720
and check the current command number

291
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,880
and so if the current command number is

292
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
zero

293
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,839
then we draw

294
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,800
kind of like a

295
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800
castle

296
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,639
on the left side of this text so

297
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,959
somewhere around here

298
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,680
so in the case so x minus gp dot type

299
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:45,040
size or something like that

300
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,880
and we can use the same y

301
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,120
and so if we want to use um like a image

302
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,240
icon instead of this

303
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,880
then uh

304
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,480
yeah you can use a draw image instead of

305
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
this drawstring

306
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,839
here let's check

307
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,639
yeah so like

308
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:09,199
this so now let's add this if statement

309
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:12,240
to this load game and uh create two

310
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,800
and we're gonna change this command num

311
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,680
one and the two

312
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,880
and now we edit the key handler so we

313
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,240
can change this command num by pressing

314
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,680
a key

315
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,800
so yeah open key handler

316
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,800
and first we

317
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,040
at an if statement i think

318
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
title

319
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
state

320
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,120
if

321
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,720
dp dot

322
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,839
game state

323
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
equal gp dot title state

324
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,880
then

325
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
we add some key input and this time we

326
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
use

327
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,199
w key and s key

328
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,720
to

329
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,079
move up and move down the castle

330
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,240
so

331
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,240
let's follow copy this

332
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,480
and okay so

333
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,920
if we press w then

334
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:18,000
we call this command num

335
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,800
and we decrease this command the num

336
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,160
and if you press s key then castle

337
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,160
should go down so

338
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,839
we increase

339
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,920
this command num

340
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,920
yeah like this okay let's check

341
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,959
all right so if you press s key

342
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,560
yeah like this and if you press w key

343
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,839
like this

344
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,240
but

345
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,600
yeah now we can move this castle but the

346
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,320
castle disappears when we hit w

347
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,279
at new game or hit s

348
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,279
ad quit because command num keeps

349
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,000
increasing or decreasing

350
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,279
so

351
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,279
we want to change it so when we hit

352
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:09,600
s key at this quit then the castle loop

353
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:14,160
back to this new game so

354
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,040
here we add if statement and

355
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:23,160
ui dot command

356
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,160
num if command num is less than zero

357
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,880
then

358
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,279
2

359
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,279
copy

360
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,160
and this time

361
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,399
so

362
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,759
larger than two

363
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,720
then

364
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,120
comma the num is zero

365
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,120
like this

366
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880
yeah so now the castle is like

367
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,399
looping

368
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,279
like this

369
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,600
all right so now let's add enter key

370
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:08,079
input so we can execute these options

371
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,880
and for now we'll take care of this new

372
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,280
game and this script

373
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,480
since you know we haven't implemented

374
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,720
save and load function yet so

375
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,600
we'll leave this for now

376
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,919
so we're gonna add another key input

377
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,919
called

378
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,120
key event dot vk

379
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,400
enter

380
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,160
and here first we check the current

381
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,360
command num

382
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,440
so we can use switch or

383
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
if statement

384
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,559
a

385
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,200
pui dot

386
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:54,000
command num if command num is zero

387
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,640
then that means we are selecting

388
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,200
new game so

389
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,559
games so we gonna change

390
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,559
the game state to

391
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,919
playstate

392
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,679
and also we can start the music i think

393
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,080
so

394
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,080
play music

395
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,000
and then

396
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,280
that command

397
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,360
equal one so which means uh

398
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,600
load the game so yeah

399
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,120
add later

400
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,320
and finally

401
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,320
quit option

402
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,799
so if user select this option then we

403
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
we're gonna

404
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,840
exit

405
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,840
this program so exit

406
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,320
let's check

407
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,880
all right okay first let's select to

408
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,320
this quit

409
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,360
press enter

410
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
oops

411
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,360
why

412
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,559
doesn't work

413
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,799
ah not three why i

414
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,799
i don't know why i put three it's two

415
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
all right

416
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,120
quit

417
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,960
yeah so we can finish the program

418
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,160
and if you

419
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,640
choose new game press enter so game

420
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
starts

421
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,640
alright so that's basically it

422
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,919
and from here it's a little extra

423
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,600
section so you can skip this if you are

424
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,960
not interested

425
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,760
but anyways maybe some of you guys want

426
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,640
to add a bit more stuff such as a

427
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,039
character making screen or displaying

428
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,240
basic control or

429
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,880
story summary or something like that

430
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,159
so i will create a

431
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,000
bare bones mock-up character class

432
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,400
selection screen

433
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
so it's just for demonstration and has

434
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,039
no actual function

435
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,760
but

436
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,039
i hope you get some ideas for your own

437
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
project

438
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,720
so basically you can add another

439
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,440
game state such as

440
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,640
character creation state or

441
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,120
story

442
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,320
summary state or something like that but

443
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,159
then we will likely end up creating tons

444
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,080
of game states

445
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,039
and uh personally i want to avoid that

446
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,039
so

447
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,559
instead we create kind of a sub state in

448
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,080
this uh

449
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,159
title state

450
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,679
so in this ui class

451
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,600
okay we're gonna create

452
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,200
integer and

453
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,520
i'm gonna name this

454
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,039
title

455
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,039
scrolling state

456
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,000
and

457
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,799
type zero

458
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
so

459
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,480
this time

460
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,080
i'm going to use this number as like for

461
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
example i can

462
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,400
state 0 is

463
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,760
the first

464
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,679
screen

465
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,840
and the state 1 is

466
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:23,039
the second screen or something like that

467
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,960
all right then let's go to this uh

468
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,000
journal title screen

469
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,720
and the first we check the

470
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,799
title screen state

471
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,200
so title

472
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,240
screen state so equal zero

473
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,880
then

474
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,200
we draw this uh you know new game load

475
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,200
game screen

476
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,120
like this

477
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,320
and then

478
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,919
we gonna

479
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,840
create another

480
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,760
condition

481
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,000
if title screen state

482
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,000
call one

483
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,159
and okay so

484
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,559
this keyhander are two

485
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,600
so the inside of this title stative

486
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,600
statement first we check the substate

487
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,760
the current substate

488
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,480
gp dot ui dot

489
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,480
title screen state

490
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,000
and okay so

491
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
move everything inside

492
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,960
so we edit this a little bit so if we

493
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,240
select this

494
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,440
new game

495
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,840
then uh

496
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,840
instead of starting the game but

497
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,880
we gonna change the

498
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,640
title screen state

499
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,880
to one

500
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,600
so we can move on to the

501
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,799
character class selection screen

502
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,600
so

503
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,799
here we can draw the screen

504
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,919
dot

505
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,919
set color

506
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,039
dot white

507
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,520
and

508
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,520
font size

509
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,960
selection

510
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,880
schooling

511
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,200
and okay string

512
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,520
text

513
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,080
and select

514
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,080
your class

515
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,280
and

516
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,279
x equal

517
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,960
get x4

518
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,640
centered

519
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,279
text

520
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,279
text

521
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,000
y

522
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,880
time three or something

523
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,120
and the draw

524
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,000
string

525
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,360
text and x on the y

526
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,360
okay and then next text is

527
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,919
text

528
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,919
we call

529
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,960
fighter

530
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,840
and okay x we can copy this

531
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,440
and y

532
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,159
plus

533
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,840
beta tile size

534
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,440
times three

535
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,120
and copy

536
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,880
and paste

537
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,840
and also

538
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,679
yeah

539
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,960
let's display the castle so if

540
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,919
command

541
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
num

542
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,360
equal

543
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
zero

544
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,039
then

545
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,039
g2 dot draw structuring

546
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,320
and ok x

547
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,320
minus gp dot type site

548
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,720
all right let's copy this and okay

549
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,159
so fighter

550
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,520
thief

551
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,240
and uh

552
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,919
so salah

553
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,039
and finally

554
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,840
okay

555
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,559
buck or

556
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,520
cancel and okay fine

557
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,520
command number one

558
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,279
two

559
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,840
three so this time we have four options

560
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,320
and okay

561
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:49,760
so change this to one tile one tile and

562
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,640
maybe this is two tiles

563
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,520
now take care of the key hundred

564
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,480
so

565
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,480
i don't know maybe we can copy this

566
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,799
and paste

567
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,039
it here

568
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,320
so this time we're gonna check

569
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,240
title screen state is one

570
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,440
then

571
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:17,360
yeah wbs basically it works the same but

572
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,159
uh this time we have four options so

573
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:24,240
we change this number to three

574
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,159
and we're gonna add one more

575
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,880
num so three

576
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,880
and okay

577
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,799
and yeah okay

578
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,640
so this

579
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,279
command num0 is selecting a fight across

580
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,320
yeah you can probably add some fighter

581
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,320
specific stats

582
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,200
so

583
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,200
do some

584
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
specific

585
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,720
and so this

586
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
one

587
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,880
so this is safe

588
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,880
and

589
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,320
sorcerer

590
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
and then

591
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,840
and if you want to start the game here

592
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,039
then uh

593
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,039
change the game state

594
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,200
to

595
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,200
play state

596
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,159
or if you want to add more stuff then

597
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,840
you can create another

598
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,919
sub state and

599
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,919
yeah do whatever you want

600
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,799
and for this fourth option this is a

601
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,919
back button so

602
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,679
if user select this option then uh

603
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,200
we're gonna change this uh

604
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
title

605
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,240
screen state to zero

606
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,320
so we can go back to the

607
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,520
previous screen

608
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,520
okay that's it i guess so let's check

609
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,919
all right

610
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,960
and the first choose this new game

611
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,399
oops what the freak

612
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,120
sorry

613
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,520
apparently

614
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,520
wait a minute

615
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,640
enter

616
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,640
okay

617
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
oh

618
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,399
else

619
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,559
and also

620
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,559
this is not necessary now right

621
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,640
okay

622
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
okay

623
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,000
entire yes okay select your class

624
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,760
it's a very primitive

625
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,159
character class selection screen

626
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,039
and if you press back

627
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,760
yeah

628
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,120
so we can go back

629
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,320
yeah so you can choose whatever class

630
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,039
you want

631
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,039
like save

632
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,320
so yeah do some save specific stuff

633
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,840
okay

634
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,600
so we have created a mock-up class

635
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,720
selection screen

636
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,600
so that's basically it

637
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,600
that's how you create a title screen

638
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:40,430
thanks for watching and until next time

639
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:40,430
