00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,960
hi guys here's another extra video of my 2D game tutorial

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,880
although we will edit our code a little bit at the end

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,720
the main theme of this video is pixel art

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,320
so you can continue tutorial without applying the changes in this video so don't worry

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,160
but if you are interested in pixel art or how the game's graphics have changed, please keep watching

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,239
if you have been checking the community tab on my channel you might know that i've been working on the pixel art of the game for a while

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,559
i kind of like the original look of the game

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,760
it's simple, blocky, and very 8-bit

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,280
and to be honest, i was never really interested in drawing pixel art

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,000
i was more into programming

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,320
and also drawing pixel art looked very difficult and require some special skill and talent

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,720
but then i stumbled upon youtube channels such as pixel pete or adam she units

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,400
these channels provide really good pixel art tutorials 

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,720
and made me feel maybe i can also improve my tiles a little bit

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,640
so they actually picked my interest in drawing pixel art

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
so first of all i wanna say huge thanks to these channels

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,840
i think this didn't happen if i didn't find their channels

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,560
so i decided to work on my tiles and i had these six tiles

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
and first i started working on the grass tile

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,880
so instead of putting these random dots 

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,280
throughout the

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
tile

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,640
so i decided to draw three glasses like

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
this

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,319
yeah something like this

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
so it looks like this but i felt this

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
was a

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,400
a bit too much

55
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,400
so i also created

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,720
this totally blank

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
all green grass style

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,319
and

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
decided to use this as the main grass

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
style and

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,040
so use this one as kind of an accent

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
tile so

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,920
i changed every grass tile to the blank

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,360
green tile and at the

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,360
accent tile here and there

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
so it looked like this

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,599
so now we have two graph styles

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,879
so blank one and uh accent one

69
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,000
then i worked on the tree tile not much

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,319
change but i deleted this

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
dot

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,599
and changed the color and also edited

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,599
the shading a little bit

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,400
so yeah i'm still not really satisfied

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
with how this shading looks

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,640
but

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,239
yeah for now this is how it looks

78
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,239
yeah so like this

79
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,120
then i started working on the water tile

80
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
and this was quite a work because

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,879
i wanted to

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,640
take care of the edge

83
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,000
of these tiles

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,360
and for this one pixel pead has made an

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,519
amazing water tile tutorial so

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,439
i recommend you to check that

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,239
so anyway to take care of the edge

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,360
nicely we need to create several

89
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,680
patterns first i deleted this

90
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,040
white dot

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,959
and also changed the watercolor a little

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,040
bit

93
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,479
and then pick the color from the glass

94
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,440
tile

95
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,440
and draw the edge of the land like this

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,479
then created the earth part like this

97
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,440
then choose a bit darker color and

98
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
create shadow

99
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,720
and then randomize it a little bit

100
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,080
yeah something like this

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,240
so then choose a dark green color so

102
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,120
darker than this gray style

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,440
and draw the edge of this glass

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,440
like this

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
like this

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
and uh

107
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,720
to create a bit more smooth transition i

108
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,360
picked a bit lighter green than this

109
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,600
and put it here and there

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
like

111
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,240
this then pick the watercolor again and

112
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
choose a bit darker

113
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,720
this time

114
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
to create some shadow

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,440
oops

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
like this

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
and i also used a bit

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
lighter color

119
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,720
than this

120
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
and

121
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
add some accent

122
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,639
accent to here something

123
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,600
like this

124
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,600
a bit darker

125
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
something like

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,160
this very subtle

127
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,120
yeah

128
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,960
okay so let's expand this image a little

129
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,080
bit so

130
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,080
place this here

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,960
okay

132
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,960
and for the opposite bank

133
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,960
so

134
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,360
okay

135
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,360
and for the side bunks

136
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,240
something like this so for the

137
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,520
cyberbunks i included the earth or dart

138
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
a little bit

139
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,240
but i think either way is fine i've

140
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
noticed some games show ours on the

141
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,319
cyberbunk

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,800
and some games don't so just show the

143
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,039
grasses and water

144
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,800
and now create

145
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,360
a tile which connects this top bank and

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,360
this cyberpunk

147
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,300
[Music]

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,440
okay

149
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:33,160
then create a tile which connects this

150
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,160
bottom bunk and this side bunk

151
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,959
okay

152
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,959
and then

153
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,279
so you can

154
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,839
flip these images horizontally

155
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,839
like this

156
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,480
and then we create four more tiles

157
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
so

158
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,839
so i chose several colors between white

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,519
and this watercolor and created a little

160
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,160
gradation

161
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,680
yeah so that's it for the

162
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,880
water tile

163
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,839
so in the end i created uh

164
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,880
14

165
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,920
variations okay so the next is this sand

166
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,360
tile i was using this sand tile as a

167
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,120
kind of a

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,480
you know load

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,839
so i decided to make this look more like

170
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,120
a load

171
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,839
so i first i deleted the dot then i

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,120
picked a little darker color than this

173
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,320
base color

174
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,320
and created some pattern

175
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,839
dude

176
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,519
and what i did was basically the same as

177
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,200
the water tiles

178
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,560
so i created 11 patterns

179
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,800
so it can handles most of the

180
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
situation

181
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,000
and now

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,200
as for that tile

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,560
and for this one i just i don't know i

184
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,959
didn't i didn't have any good idea so i

185
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,560
just uh you know randomize the pattern

186
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,110
basically

187
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,299
it's like uh really randomly

188
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,299
[Music]

189
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,120
yeah something like this

190
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,360
and finally the wall tile

191
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
i decided to keep using this brick

192
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,399
pattern and

193
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,399
make it a bit more detailed

194
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,079
so basically i change the brightness of

195
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,079
this gray color

196
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,399
so

197
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,519
yes something like this

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,639
so i used a

199
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,639
gray color and changed the

200
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,920
like a brightness and so created some

201
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,000
shadows and

202
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,839
gradation

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
and so and kind of london right

204
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,560
randomize it

205
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
yeah

206
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,760
so

207
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,120
that's everything i think

208
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,600
i ended up

209
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
creating 32 tiles

210
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,959
yeah let's implement these styles and

211
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,279
see how they look like in the game

212
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,800
and first we need to

213
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,560
increase the size of this tile array

214
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,079
you know since we have more than 10

215
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,000
tiles now so like

216
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,320
yeah 50

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
should be enough for now and

218
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,440
yeah we can always increase the size

219
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:26,240
whenever we want then we can add new

220
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:29,519
tiles to like a atari index 678

221
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,959
yeah that's basically it but um i

222
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,959
decided to

223
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,120
not to use this you know index 0 to 9

224
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,440
tiles so

225
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,560
7 8 9

226
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
8

227
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,639
9

228
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,639
sold

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
so i just put the

230
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,040
this

231
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,040
blank grass style to

232
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,720
index 0 to 9 as a placeholder

233
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,040
and we're going to start from uh

234
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,639
index 10

235
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,720
and this is also a paragraph style but

236
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,480
this is the actual graph style we're

237
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,680
going to use and

238
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,760
these nine tiles we don't use

239
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,639
but i put this grass style as a

240
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,920
placeholder because otherwise you know

241
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,120
it can get

242
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,240
not point except exception error and i

243
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,519
need to add an extra code to avoid that

244
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,440
and that's a little bit too much pain

245
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,360
and the reason

246
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,079
i wanted to start from

247
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,880
index 10 is pretty simple

248
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,079
right now we are only using single digit

249
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,360
number

250
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,560
to create this world map but uh

251
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,000
if we add two digit numbers too

252
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,000
then it becomes like this

253
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,639
so single digit number and the two digit

254
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,880
numbers are mixed like this then uh

255
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,320
it kind of disturbs the placement of

256
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,720
these numbers

257
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,680
and make it a bit

258
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,800
harder to read or look

259
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,160
so program-wise it still works just fine

260
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,000
no problem

261
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,519
so it's purely

262
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,519
like appearance reason

263
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,279
so

264
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,880
i update new tiles like this

265
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,880
so these are placeholder

266
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,880
so from here so these are the tiles

267
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,759
we're gonna use

268
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,440
yeah and this is the new map file

269
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:51,440
so every number is two digit like this

270
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,839
and i also changed the map a little bit

271
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,639
so in the old

272
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,680
map the world was surrounded by these

273
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,079
trees so as if we are in uh

274
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,560
like a big forest or something

275
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,399
but i thought it's a bit boring so i

276
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,800
decided to surround the land by water

277
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,160
so now our world became an

278
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,040
island

279
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,320
so yeah okay let's delete

280
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,839
these all old tiles

281
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,839
and copy these new tiles

282
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,759
and also

283
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,079
yeah

284
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:33,120
now we're gonna use this word world b2

285
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,839
file so let's change the

286
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,000
file path to

287
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,160
word with two

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,199
okay so i think everything is ready so

289
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,199
yeah let's take a look

290
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,600
yeah

291
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:01,220
yeah like this so now

292
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:07,679
it's surrounded by water

293
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:09,589
[Music]

294
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:27,549
so

295
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:27,549
[Music]

296
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,440
hmm

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,840
yeah i think this looks better

298
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,600
yeah and this is where we

299
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,760
we found a treasure chest

300
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,760
but in the second half we're gonna place

301
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,300
a different thing

302
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,000
looks good

303
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,480
[Music]

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,480
so yeah i think everything is placed

305
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,480
correctly

306
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,679
yeah so this is the new look of the game

307
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,200
it took about a week to create those

308
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,919
tiles but uh i think it was worth it

309
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,200
and like before i'm gonna upload this

310
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,400
new tileset on my drive so so if you're

311
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,919
using

312
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,799
my tileset and wants to update to this

313
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,559
new one you can download it and

314
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,400
so i'm going to upload the

315
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,600
new map file too so you can use this

316
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,840
style set

317
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,799
in your environment too

318
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,580
anyway that's uh that's it for now so

319
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:49,360
