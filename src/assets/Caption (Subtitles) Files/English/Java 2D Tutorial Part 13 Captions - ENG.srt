00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,000
hi guys this is roy snow so

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,400
after finishing our first game i

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,519
uploaded some sort of modification

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,960
videos such as improving rendering speed

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,680
and pixel art but from this video we

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,240
actually resume the development and

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,119
starts the second half

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
as i said in the very first video of

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,320
this series

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:32,239
we will turn this into an action rpg

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,760
so no simple key finding demonstration

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,559
game anymore

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,239
and here's a bit more detailed load map

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,200
of the second half

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,559
we set game state so we can handle

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,160
various situations in the game we create

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
an npc and dialog system so we can talk

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,399
to them

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,920
we create more detailed player stats

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,480
such as player life level attack defense

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
experience stuff like that

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,280
we create monsters and

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,119
implement a simple ai

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,840
so they spawn on the map and move around

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,360
and we implement a battle system so

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,400
player can attack and receive damage

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,600
then we implement inventory so we are

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,720
not just adding plus one to integer

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
variable

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,520
but

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,200
handle this in more

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,680
object oriented way this will be a bit

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
tricky one but i will explain step by

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
step

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,439
and

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,040
we also add them merchant npc so we can

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,240
buy and sell items with them

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,520
and uh we create title screen and game

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,119
over screen

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,320
we handle this by switching game state

41
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,960
and uh we also implement a little

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,040
interaction with environment

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,079
not gonna go too deep into this area but

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,320
a twist will be able to cut trees with

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,280
an axe

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,280
and there's some more

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,319
and besides this i might add other stuff

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,280
if i come up with some ideas or receive

49
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,160
some ideas through comments

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,319
so

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,360
in any case feel free to leave a comment

52
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,319
whenever you don't understand something

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,879
or

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,200
you have some features to implement

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,080
anything is fine

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
okay

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
in this first episode of the second half

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
we

59
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,879
implement

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,120
gamestate and

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,200
as a part of this game state we

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,879
implement a pause screen so we can pause

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,160
the game and while implementing this we

64
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,879
also do a little housekeeping and delete

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,200
stuff that we don't use anymore

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,959
so let's start

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,319
okay so first we create some integers

68
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,720
this is

69
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,720
game

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,200
statement and public hint

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
game state

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,519
and also public

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,800
final in

74
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:21,760
a play state equal one

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,040
and public final int

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,640
power power state

77
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
equal to

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
so

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
what is game state

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,640
when you play a game

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,200
usually it has various game situations

82
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,360
such as title screen

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
the main gameplay screen

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
or

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,480
in game menu screen

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,040
stuff like that

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,440
and depending on the situation

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,560
the program draws different things on

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,439
the screen

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,360
and often receive different

91
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,879
key input

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,519
for example

93
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,159
you can swing your sword by pressing

94
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,280
enter in gameplay state

95
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,000
but maybe enter works as confirmation

96
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,599
key in many screen

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,400
so we handle this by telling our program

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,360
what kind of game state we are in right

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
now

100
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,639
so i just put one to this play state and

101
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,759
the two to

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,000
this pulse state but basically you can

103
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,520
choose any number

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
and for now we start the game with this

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
play state

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,639
so

107
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
in this setup game

108
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,360
we set the default game state

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,280
game state

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,600
equal play state

111
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
you know uh technically you don't really

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,560
need to create these

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
and uh

114
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,240
so typing like

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,600
like these

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
but uh

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
the reason i didn't do that is because

118
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,280
um

119
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,320
maybe you want to switch these numbers

120
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,199
later

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,000
maybe i want to use 0 for pause state

122
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,919
and uh yeah 2 for play state or

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,440
something and 1 for title screen or

124
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,560
something like that

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,280
if you are

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,080
putting numbers like this manually then

127
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
uh

128
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
when you change

129
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,880
this you know kind of allocation then

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,440
you will track everything and change

131
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,800
this number one two three or something

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,039
like that

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,320
but if you have set

134
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,199
individual state like this then you only

135
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,479
need to change you know this number like

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,479
this then uh

137
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
then this automatically adjusts the

138
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,960
change

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,120
so as always fine but uh

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,840
this time we're gonna set each game

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
state like this

142
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,320
okay

143
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
and then

144
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,440
and then go to update

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,199
method here

146
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,400
and we create an if statement like this

147
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,080
if

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,280
gamestate

149
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,479
equal one no not one

150
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
uh play

151
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,960
state

152
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,199
then we're gonna call display a dot

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
update

154
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,800
and if

155
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,479
game state

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,479
recall pause state

157
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,000
then

158
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,000
nothing for now

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,479
what this means is we don't update the

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,039
player information while the game is

161
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:40,319
paused so we cannot move our sprite

162
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,720
okay then go to this keyhandra

163
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
and create a shortcut for

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,440
pausing the game

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:52,319
but first we create a constructor and

166
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,319
receive game panel because we need it

167
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,720
this dot gp

168
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,319
then

169
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,319
accept a key input

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,720
copy and paste

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,319
and i'm going to use

172
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
p key

173
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,440
for pause but you can choose whatever

174
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,120
key you want

175
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
and if

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
gp dot

177
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,960
game state

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,520
equal gp dot

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,759
play state

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,080
then we're gonna change this to power

181
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
state so game state

182
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,879
state

183
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,759
and uh else if

184
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,160
gp.gamestate

185
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,520
equal gp dot

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,840
pause state

187
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,360
gp dot games

188
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,960
state

189
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,520
gold gb dot play state

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,680
yeah like this

191
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
and then go to

192
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,280
this ui class

193
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,440
and we'll do a little housekeeping here

194
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,919
since uh

195
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,400
most of the stuff here is for our

196
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,560
previous treasure hunting game so we're

197
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,120
not gonna use anymore

198
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,120
so first delete this one

199
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,440
and this one

200
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,440
and this one

201
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,560
we're not gonna display the key image or

202
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,279
key number on the screen anymore

203
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,200
and uh okay and inside with straw method

204
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,880
basically

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,880
we we're gonna delete everything

206
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,120
and yeah everything

207
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,800
okay then inside of this ui class first

208
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,680
we're gonna declare

209
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,680
this graphic study

210
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,959
and inside of this draw method

211
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,080
this

212
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,720
g2

213
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,160
equal g2

214
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,959
we do this so we can use this g2 in

215
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,279
other methods in this class

216
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
okay then we set a

217
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,120
default font

218
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:37,680
so g2 dot set font

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,839
so okay for now let's use this area 40

220
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,519
and the g2 dot set

221
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,480
color

222
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
correct

223
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,480
white

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,680
and here we check the current game state

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,040
if

226
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,920
gp dot

227
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
game state

228
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,080
equal

229
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,080
gp dot play state

230
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
then

231
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,160
to

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
play state

233
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,320
stuff

234
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,320
later

235
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
and

236
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,839
gp dot

237
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,680
game state

238
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,880
call gp dot

239
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,360
parts

240
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
state

241
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,399
maybe you can

242
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
maybe we can use switch

243
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
for this

244
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,920
but yeah if statement is okay too i

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
think

246
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,920
and so we're gonna type

247
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,600
what we're gonna do or draw during this

248
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,880
play state and

249
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,640
pause state and technically we can type

250
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,079
everything here

251
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,279
but then this draw method will be really

252
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,560
long

253
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,120
and huge

254
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,079
and kind of hard to track what is

255
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,120
happening

256
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,000
so we will handle situations by

257
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
splitting them to methods

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,839
so

259
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,560
first we create

260
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,760
method called

261
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
draw

262
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
powers

263
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
screen

264
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,200
and we gonna call this from here

265
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
so

266
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,399
we're gonna do all the pause screen

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
stuff in this method

268
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,440
okay first

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
string

270
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,399
text

271
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,880
equal

272
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,880
paused

273
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,279
and also we're gonna create x and

274
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,720
y

275
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,279
and uh

276
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,519
finally d2 dot draw

277
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,839
string

278
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,120
text and x and y so we want to display

279
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,160
this

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,800
at the

281
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,560
center of the screen

282
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,279
and finding this y is kind of easy you

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,040
just need to type like this gp dot

284
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,959
square

285
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
height

286
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,519
divided by 2

287
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,000
and for this x

288
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,480
it's basically the same as

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,519
congratulations text that we displayed

290
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
in a

291
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,600
previous game so

292
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,600
it's gonna be like this

293
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
pink links

294
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,639
g2 dot

295
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,639
get

296
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,519
text

297
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,560
context is g2

298
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
and

299
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
get

300
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,920
width

301
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,200
and x

302
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,560
equal

303
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
gp dot

304
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,680
screen

305
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
reads

306
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
divided by 2

307
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,399
minus

308
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,880
length divided by two

309
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,880
so this way we can display the text at

310
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,000
the center of the screen

311
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,160
but we will likely do this calculation

312
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,120
again and again throughout the

313
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,880
development and typing this

314
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,360
every time

315
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,000
is kind of too much pain so

316
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,320
let's handle this with a method

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,120
public hint

318
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
and get x

319
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,800
for

320
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,040
centered

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,680
text or something like that

322
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,800
and we get string

323
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,800
and text

324
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,680
and basically we gonna

325
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,880
cut down the copy here

326
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
yeah

327
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,639
so

328
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,639
index

329
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,199
and we're gonna return this x

330
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,839
so

331
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,839
now we only need to call this

332
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,079
get x4 center text and pass this text

333
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,360
so this way whenever we want to get the

334
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,199
x for

335
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,279
centered text

336
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,959
we just need to call

337
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,079
this method

338
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,760
okay this ui class is done for now

339
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,480
and now we'll do another housekeeping so

340
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,720
go to playerclass

341
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,880
and delete

342
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
this one

343
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,720
husky

344
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,160
so we don't use this anymore

345
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
and also

346
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,040
inside of this pickup object method

347
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:58,079
we're gonna delete everything

348
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,959
but this if statement

349
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,880
yeah

350
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,399
and then go to this

351
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
asset setup

352
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,920
and

353
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,440
so since these are all for

354
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
the treasure hunting game so

355
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,079
delete everything

356
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,880
and inside of this game panel let's pass

357
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,480
this game panel to the constructor of

358
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,800
keyhandra

359
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,839
okay i think that's everything

360
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,839
so let's check the program

361
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,440
okay i'm gonna press p key

362
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,000
maybe i want to make the text a bit

363
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,040
larger

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
so

365
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,079
yeah here so g2

366
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,600
set font

367
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,399
g2 dot

368
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,399
get font

369
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,240
derive font

370
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
maybe

371
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,720
right now it's 40 so

372
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
like 80.

373
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,160
okay yeah looks good

374
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,079
so now we can pause the game

375
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,839
so even if i press

376
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,160
wsd keys

377
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,399
the character doesn't respond while game

378
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,399
is paused

379
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,680
alright i think that's it for now

380
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,079
and in the next video we will implement

381
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:40,920
an npc and maybe direct system as well

382
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,920
thanks for watching and until next time

383
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,620
