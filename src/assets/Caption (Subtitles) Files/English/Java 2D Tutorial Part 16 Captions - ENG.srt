1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,180
and now let's talk about the font in game

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,080
so if you like the current Arial font,
you can skip this part

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,560
but maybe you think 
this Arial font looks a bit too generic

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,540
maybe you want to test a different font
and see how it looks

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,540
you can change the font by changing the name here

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,480
but it's not like you can type anything
the font needs to be in your computer

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,160
in this Windows folder, 
you can find this Fonts folder

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,720
then you can see the fonts in your computer

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,480
for example, I have this Cambria font

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,160
so i can change this to Cambria

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,380
so it looks like this

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,440
but there is a slight problem in this method

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,740
since the font is dependent on local environment

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,260
so for example, once you finish your development
if you export your game and...

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,460
let your friends play it

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,400
you never know what fonts are in their computer

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:27,160
so to make sure the correct font will be displayed
we can include the font in our program package

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,260
then your desired font will surely be displayed
in any environment

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,260
this is what most of the game developers do
when they create a game

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,880
including a font file in your program package

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,000
which is especially crucial when you localize your game
into other languages

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
so first thing you need to do is prepare a font file

23
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,420
and i think it needs to be a true type font

24
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,420
if it's true type font, you can use any font

25
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,160
and this time I've prepared two fonts

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,980
the one is a pixel font called MaruMonica

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,840
this was created by a Japanese creator 
and this is so far my favorite pixel font

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,300
it's completely free
and you can use it for both personal and commercial purpose

29
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,120
and readability is pretty good for a pixel font

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,700
and the other one is this Purisa Bold

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,780
so this is just for testing to show how it looks
since this is a pretty unique font

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,340
so first, inside of this res folder

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,620
create another package
and name this "font"

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,600
copy this font file to this package

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,620
Purisa Bold and also MaruMonica

36
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,020
then we're gonna import these fonts

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,740
I'm gonna delete these Arial

38
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:19,380
and instead maruMonica and prisaB or something

39
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,060
and I'm going to delete this too

40
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,600
so here we're gonna instantiate the font

41
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,080
and here we input a file pass

42
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,540
let me get the file name

43
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,420
and import InputStream

44
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,500
then

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,320
and the font file is "is"... InputStream

46
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,840
and i think we need to surround this
with try and catch

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,800
so we need to catch these two exceptions

48
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,020
FontFormatException and IOException

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,620
and okay one more font

50
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
can i move this inside of this try?

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,320
is this okay? Ah okay

52
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,700
then let's import another one too

53
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,220
and copy, yep, okay

54
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,380
so now these two fonts are instantiated 

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,080
so instead of this arial_40, 
let's use this maruMonica

56
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,840
okay let me increase the font size a little bit

57
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,960
so this is how MaruMonica font looks

58
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,040
I like this retro feel a lot

59
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,380
so now let's try Prisa Bold too

60
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,240
i just copy this and...

61
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,780
comment out and purisaB...

62
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,360
this font is much larger than MaruMonica so...

63
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,320
text is bleeding out of the frame again but

64
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,060
anyways as you can see 
it gives you a completely different feel

65
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,920
so font is actually pretty important 
it sets the atmosphere of your game

66
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm gonna use MaruMonica for this game
but you can test any font you like

67
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,750
and please find one you like the best

68
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:52,920
and also if you don't like the jaggy of this kind of font,
you can set anti-alias on

69
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,720
so when you set the font,
you can add this line

70
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,640
yeah like this let's check

71
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,700
can you see the difference?

72
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,660
and for this MaruMonica
this anti-aliasing doesn't work

73
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,440
i guess that's because this is a pixel
that kinda makes sense I think

74
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,720
yeah anyway that's everything for now

75
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,940
this turned out to be a pretty long video

76
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,220
but now we can talk to NPCs

77
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,060
and in the next video,
 i think we will implement player life

78
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,780
and also create an Event class 
so we can add some events

79
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,980
so thanks for watching
and until next time

80
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:14,279
