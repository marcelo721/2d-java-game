00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,879
hi guys this is roy snow last time we

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,400
implemented gamestate so we can pause

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,440
the game now

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,040
and in this video we will create an npc

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,800
and implement it into the game so let's

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,119
start okay so first

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,760
inside of this rest folder

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,240
create another package

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
and name this npc

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,640
[Music]

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,160
and i have created this old man sprites

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
with biscuit

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,239
so

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,040
like the player sprite this also has

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,680
8 variations

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,480
so you can use these images or you can

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,360
prepare your own sprites

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,280
so let's copy this image

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,280
to this npc package

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,199
and before creating this npc we'll do a

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,120
little housekeeping so this is kind of a

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,960
preparation for creating npc class

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,280
in this entity class

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
we create a constructor

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,720
a public

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,400
entity

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,040
and we get

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,439
game panel

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,439
gp

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
desktop gp

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,040
equal gp

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,920
and okay

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,520
game

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,119
panel

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,720
gp

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,960
because we want to use this game panel

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
in this entity class this time

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,560
okay so now we are seeing this error

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
the fix is pretty simple so we just need

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
to pass this game panel

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
to

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,399
this entity's constructor

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,320
so

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,840
super

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,799
gp

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,040
then the error disappeared

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,479
so this means we are calling the

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
constructor

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,560
of the superclass of this class

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,479
and passing this gp

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,520
and so this entity

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,640
is so called abstract class

53
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,319
meaning this class has no instance

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,840
so we always instantiate this as a

55
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,920
player class or on npg class or monster

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,360
class so we don't instantiate entity

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,120
as entity

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,519
since entity is just a blueprint for

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,720
these character classes

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,160
so

61
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,200
if we don't pass gp when we instantiate

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
a class

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,840
the entity cannot receive

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,720
this gp

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,959
so that's why this line is necessary to

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,560
make this code work

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,120
so now entity class also has game panel

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,280
we can delete this game panel in player

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
class

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,560
and also this one

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,920
and yeah we don't need this anymore

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,599
okay so that's all for the housekeeping

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,720
so let's create an npc class

74
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,760
okay

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,200
inside of this entity package

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,239
we create a class and i'm gonna name

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
this

78
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,120
npc

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
old man

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,840
all right

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,560
and so this class extends

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,400
entity

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
and the constructor

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,040
public

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,519
npc

86
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,360
old mem

87
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,360
game panel gp

88
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,720
here as well so we need to pass this gp

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
to

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,319
to the entity class

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,319
and okay so first we set direction

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,760
down

93
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,959
and also speed

94
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,640
since he's an old man so he moves a bit

95
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,400
slower so

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,959
i'm gonna set one

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,360
we can also set the

98
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,560
solid area

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,239
uh

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,239
if you don't need to set it individually

101
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,199
then you can set it in

102
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,720
this entity class so all the characters

103
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:30,639
can share

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,240
so it's like this solid area equal new

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,800
rectangle

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
and so x 0

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,199
y 0

108
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,960
48

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,479
48

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,000
so this is the default solid area for

111
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,280
all entity

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,720
and if we want to override it then

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,919
yeah you can set value here

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,919
like this player graph

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,400
okay next we import these images

116
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,320
and for the images we we can basically

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
copy

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,800
uh

119
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,400
these methods from playerclass

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,320
so like

121
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,720
copy and uh paste here

122
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,440
yeah so this works fine basically but

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,880
uh i don't know i think

124
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,520
this feels like kind of redundant so we

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,840
are doing almost the same thing in both

126
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
player class and uh

127
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,720
this

128
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
old main class

129
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
so yeah i think

130
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
i'm gonna move

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,199
this setup

132
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,039
to this entity class

133
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
the problem is this

134
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
package pass

135
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,280
so

136
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,520
i think so we can delete this

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,199
on the instead we include the package

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,039
path

139
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,520
when we send this string like this

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,160
player

141
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,000
yeah so delete this from this player

142
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,520
class 2 and

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,319
add this

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,319
package path

145
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,639
and that's so here okay

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,639
we don't need this

147
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
so for this old man

148
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,639
package passes and pc

149
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,840
and uh okay

150
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,840
so all the main

151
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,600
so since we don't have this setup method

152
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,639
in this subclass anymore so this

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,400
automatically calls a method in this

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,600
superclass

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,520
yeah

156
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,639
yeah this is not the image name but the

157
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
image

158
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,360
path

159
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,479
sounds more

160
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
accurate

161
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,240
after all

162
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,400
i apologize for the confusion sometimes

163
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,680
you find a way which works better than

164
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,840
you initially planned but that's part of

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,039
programming i think

166
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,919
and so this way we don't need to create

167
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,560
that setup method every time we create a

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,240
new character class

169
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,720
okay so back in this old man class and

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,960
okay so let's change this name this is

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,479
not player so uh

172
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,880
just get image i think

173
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,000
and i call it from here

174
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
get image

175
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,840
yeah this is okay for now so

176
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,639
now go to game panel

177
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,479
just like we did for object

178
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,400
we create an npc array

179
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,680
so public

180
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,000
entity

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,919
and pc

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
equal new

183
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,400
entity

184
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:03,199
and 10 i think then go to

185
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,479
this asset setup

186
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,960
and

187
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,240
create a method

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
public

189
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,080
void

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,080
set npc

191
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,840
and here we instantiate the

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
old man

193
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
gp.10 pc

194
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
0

195
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
equal new

196
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,160
and pc

197
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
all the mem

198
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,599
and i think we're gonna pass gp

199
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,599
yeah

200
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,000
okay and we're gonna set

201
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
his position

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,160
world x

203
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,839
i wanna place him

204
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,959
kinda close to the starting point so

205
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,360
i'm gonna

206
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,360
sit

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600
so call 21

208
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,920
and

209
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,959
law is also 21.

210
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,920
okay

211
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,959
and now inside of this game panel

212
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,320
we call the method

213
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
okay somewhere around here

214
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,480
dot set any pc

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,920
all right then

216
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,120
so inside of this paint component

217
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,080
so we draw any pc

218
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,839
so

219
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,519
probably after this object

220
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,200
npc

221
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,800
and for

222
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
int

223
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,600
i equal 0

224
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,240
i

225
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:55,440
list some any pc dot length

226
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,440
i prosperous

227
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,959
and if npc

228
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,200
i

229
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,600
not equal normal

230
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,240
then we gonna draw

231
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,160
sony pc

232
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,279
dot draw

233
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
g2

234
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,880
dot

235
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
this

236
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,600
yeah but yeah

237
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,079
we haven't created this draw method so

238
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,839
we need to create a draw method

239
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,240
and just like we did for object

240
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,600
we create a draw method

241
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,880
not in

242
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,480
this old man graph but

243
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,079
in the entity class

244
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,320
public void draw

245
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,680
we get graphics

246
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,160
2d

247
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
g2

248
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,839
and what we do here is kind of similar

249
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
to

250
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,160
a

251
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,160
very super object

252
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
so first we can

253
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
copy

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
this

255
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,920
and uh

256
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,600
paste here

257
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,079
but the difference is

258
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,680
unlike object any pc can move around and

259
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,000
has several sprite variations

260
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,959
so we need to switch the sprite

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,880
depending on its direction

262
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,839
so for this we can copy the lines from a

263
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839
player class

264
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,880
and play a draw so we just

265
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
copy this switch statement

266
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
so this

267
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,880
direction

268
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,440
choosing switch statement so copy this

269
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,279
and paste

270
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,279
inside of this if statement

271
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,480
and also

272
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,480
copy this one this line too

273
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,600
and paste here

274
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,160
okay

275
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,399
so the basic system is

276
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,639
pretty much identical to

277
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,760
the object so we find out its screen x

278
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,320
and the y

279
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,560
based on the player's position

280
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,920
and if it's in the

281
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,839
camera frame

282
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,880
then we draw it

283
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
yeah let's check this

284
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,000
oops

285
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,000
hello

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,279
what is this

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,160
draw npc draw

288
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,959
ah okay i think we don't need to pass

289
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,880
this game panel anymore because

290
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,959
this entity class already has game

291
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,920
panels so yeah

292
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,920
let's delete this

293
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,959
yep okay

294
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,000
let's check this

295
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,800
okay

296
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
yeah so now

297
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,519
the

298
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,760
npc appeared on the screen

299
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,440
but of course

300
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
he's not moving

301
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,600
so

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,600
let's move him

303
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
inside of this entity we create two

304
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,200
methods

305
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,320
the first one is

306
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
public

307
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
void

308
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,440
set

309
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,000
action and the other one is public void

310
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,000
update

311
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,000
and uh okay

312
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,399
inside of this old main class

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
we create uh

314
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,320
public void set

315
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
action

316
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,000
method here too

317
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,320
in this set action we set the

318
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,199
character's behavior

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,480
so

320
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:54,160
this kind of work as it's ai

321
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,959
and we want to set a different behavior

322
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,680
to each character so that's why we

323
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,800
created this method in this subclass

324
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,000
tool so we can override it

325
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,079
and uh

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,079
for update

327
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,959
basically it works identical in all npcs

328
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,519
so

329
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,839
we don't need to create this

330
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,000
this update

331
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,440
here we can just share the one in the

332
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,079
entity class

333
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,800
you know so if there is no update method

334
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,839
here then the program automatically

335
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,000
refer to the one in its super class

336
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,199
this might feel a bit complicated at

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
first but

338
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,160
once you get used to how this

339
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,320
inheritance works in java it's actually

340
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
a pretty convenient

341
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,680
yeah anyways let's set the

342
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,040
behavior of this character okay first

343
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,920
london

344
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,399
london equal new

345
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,399
london

346
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,079
and

347
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,279
in high i decor random dot

348
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,279
next int

349
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
100

350
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,279
plus one

351
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
so we use this random class and this

352
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,160
means

353
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,839
we get a random number from 1 to

354
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,959
100

355
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,839
i added one because otherwise it peaks

356
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,000
from

357
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
0 to 99

358
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,240
and

359
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,320
i kind of like you know 1 to 100 better

360
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,959
so that's why

361
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,920
so this basically uh

362
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,800
pick up a number

363
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
or

364
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,639
from 1 to

365
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,320
100

366
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,560
and then if statement if

367
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,560
i

368
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,639
call

369
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,680
equal or less than 25

370
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,759
then

371
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,720
direction

372
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,959
is

373
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,480
up

374
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,519
if

375
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,480
i

376
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,959
get 25

377
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,959
and

378
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,320
50

379
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,560
then

380
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,680
direction

381
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,680
called down

382
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,040
if

383
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,639
i

384
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,120
larger than 50

385
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,120
and

386
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,160
75

387
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
direction

388
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,759
recall

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,079
right no

390
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,079
left

391
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
and if

392
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,480
larger than 75

393
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,959
and

394
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,759
e4 or less than 100

395
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
then

396
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,639
direction

397
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,880
is

398
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,880
right

399
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,199
so this is like a

400
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,720
simplest ai ever

401
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,919
25 percent of the time it goes up 25

402
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,600
percent of the time it goes down and so

403
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,480
on

404
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:18,640
uh yeah so this is okay for now so

405
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
let's take care of this

406
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,039
update method

407
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,319
all right first we call

408
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,319
that set action

409
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,720
you might think but you know this set

410
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
action is empty

411
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,320
yeah but

412
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,520
we created this in this

413
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,760
old main class 2 and if the subclass has

414
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,480
the same method it takes a priority

415
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,360
and so as i said before this will be

416
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,640
used by all the npcs

417
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,720
and the code is pretty similar to

418
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,520
this player's update

419
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,840
but a bit simpler

420
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,840
okay

421
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,919
first question

422
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,679
home equal

423
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,039
false

424
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,039
and then we're going to check

425
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,840
collision

426
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,760
dot

427
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,440
check tile

428
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,880
and entities

429
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,720
this

430
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
so it's going to pass

431
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,039
this class

432
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,080
as an entity

433
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,720
and

434
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,160
for the movement i think we can just

435
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,440
copy and paste from the player graph

436
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,600
so we can

437
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,400
copy this

438
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,720
so this collision on if statement and

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,600
also this sprite counter

440
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,320
so

441
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,120
we copy this

442
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,200
and paste here

443
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,679
and okay that's it i think

444
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,039
all right and then

445
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,400
go to game panel

446
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,240
and inside of this update method so

447
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,440
we're gonna

448
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,000
update any pc2

449
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
layer

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,679
and pc

451
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,679
so another for loop

452
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,919
i

453
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,720
sign in pc dot links

454
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,160
i press plus

455
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,760
and if npc

456
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,600
hi

457
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,200
not equal

458
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,720
no

459
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,960
then we're gonna update

460
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,960
this npc

461
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,799
yeah like this i think

462
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,799
it's okay now so let's check this

463
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,160
oh

464
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,039
yeah

465
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,480
the heat

466
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,480
the envy is moving but it looks

467
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,440
terribly long

468
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,360
and yeah we can fix this

469
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,799
so what is happening here is the npc is

470
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,159
changing its direction you know rapidly

471
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,960
because right now in every frame there

472
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,159
is a chance to change the direction

473
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
so it would be better to set some kind

474
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,120
of an interval

475
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,360
all right

476
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,520
in this entity class

477
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,960
we're gonna create an

478
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,559
integer

479
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,679
power

480
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,960
public

481
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,720
int

482
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,720
i'm gonna name this

483
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,159
action

484
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,280
lock

485
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,880
counter or something

486
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,640
and go to this old man class

487
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:52,159
every time this set action gets called

488
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,159
we add this counter

489
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,440
press plus

490
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,799
okay and here we're gonna create if

491
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,840
statement

492
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,480
action

493
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,480
look counter

494
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,559
equal

495
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,039
120

496
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,480
or something

497
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,880
then

498
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,440
we're gonna pick a

499
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
direction

500
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,679
and uh

501
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,679
after that we reset the counter

502
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,960
so this way once it picked up a

503
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,799
direction

504
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,080
it won't change for the next

505
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,120
120 frames

506
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,720
which means two seconds

507
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,480
so yeah you can

508
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,840
adjust this number as you like alright

509
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,840
so let's check this again

510
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,640
yep

511
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,000
so now the npc is moving more

512
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,840
naturally

513
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,919
and

514
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,360
uh okay tile collision is i think tile

515
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,440
collision is also happening

516
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,480
let me see

517
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,520
come on

518
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,720
hit the tile hit the tile yeah yeah i

519
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,799
think uh the tile collision is also

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,880
working properly

521
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,679
but still you know

522
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,760
no collision with players so let's

523
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,480
implement it as well

524
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,720
so let's open this collision checker

525
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,000
and okay

526
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,760
inside we're gonna create another

527
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,200
method

528
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,120
public

529
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,120
int

530
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
name this check

531
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
entity

532
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,280
and

533
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,760
we're gonna get

534
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,760
entity

535
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,200
and

536
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,840
also another entity

537
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,159
and this is

538
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,159
allay and this is target

539
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,000
and we're gonna use this method to check

540
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,360
npc

541
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,480
or

542
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,000
monster collision

543
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,120
and the

544
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,120
npc collision works almost identical to

545
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,400
this

546
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,760
object

547
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,480
so i think we can

548
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,480
copy this

549
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,080
and

550
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,080
paste it here

551
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,960
and we're gonna change this

552
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,600
object to

553
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,080
this target

554
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,360
target.links

555
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,880
and here target

556
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,880
target

557
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,880
target

558
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,880
and

559
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,279
this and also

560
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,600
this and

561
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,600
this

562
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,559
and this

563
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
that's everything maybe

564
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,400
and also this time we don't need to

565
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,679
check targets

566
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
collision

567
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,960
since you know

568
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,120
unlike object

569
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,400
or any pcs or monsters are solid

570
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,840
so

571
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,840
we can just delete this

572
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
and we don't need to check if entity is

573
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,240
player

574
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,240
so we can delete these two

575
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,200
like this

576
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,279
hey

577
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,279
okay

578
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,279
these and uh delete these

579
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,679
yeah like this

580
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,039
so

581
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,360
this return

582
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,679
the index of the

583
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,200
collided npc

584
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,520
if collision didn't happen it returns

585
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,120
999

586
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,679
so now go to

587
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:28,799
display graph

588
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,679
and check the npc collision

589
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,120
check

590
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,279
npc call region

591
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,400
so hint and pc

592
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,960
index

593
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,559
equal gp dot g

594
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
check card

595
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,240
check

596
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,240
entity

597
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:52,000
and so this time first we pass this

598
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,320
player and then target

599
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,480
is

600
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,799
this npc

601
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,799
so we're gonna pass this npc array

602
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,400
as this target

603
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,880
so you know this can scan

604
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,760
this array and check if

605
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,240
any of these npcs are colliding with

606
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,240
player

607
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,400
then

608
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,279
result of the collision

609
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,000
we can type it here but i think it would

610
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,480
be better to handle it in

611
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,600
different method like this one

612
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
so

613
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,360
like in

614
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,840
interact

615
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,200
npc

616
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,200
and pc

617
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,200
index

618
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,520
so we're gonna create this method

619
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,960
uh okay somewhere around here

620
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
void

621
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,640
interacting pc

622
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,640
yeah get the index

623
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,400
copy this if statement and okay

624
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,080
uh

625
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,039
for now let's display some text

626
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,960
so

627
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,400
you are

628
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,760
hitting

629
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,640
an npc or something

630
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,520
yeah

631
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,440
okay i think so yeah let's check this

632
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,880
all right

633
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,200
console

634
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
okay

635
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,559
yeah

636
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,559
yeah collision is happening

637
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,120
but yeah

638
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,600
did you see see it yeah

639
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,600
like this

640
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,480
so now any pc collision is happening but

641
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,559
only when player

642
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,159
hit an npc

643
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:57,200
so let's implement the opposite tool so

644
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,159
any pc to player

645
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,880
so this collision checker game

646
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,240
and now we're gonna create another

647
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,840
method a public

648
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
void

649
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,279
check

650
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
player

651
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,320
and

652
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,320
ntt

653
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,320
entity

654
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,159
so this time we don't need to return the

655
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,960
index

656
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,480
so the method is void

657
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,799
and i think we can basically copy and

658
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,399
paste from this

659
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,679
check entity

660
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,679
method

661
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,960
the only difference is

662
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,960
we don't need to scan the array

663
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,760
so we can ignore that part

664
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,039
so

665
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,000
yeah i think we can just copy

666
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,240
wait

667
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,960
inside of this

668
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,840
if statement so

669
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,440
this one i

670
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,480
think copy

671
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,480
and paste

672
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,000
and this time change this target

673
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,279
to

674
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,279
player

675
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,279
gp.player

676
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,399
okay

677
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,039
yeah and uh yeah we don't need this

678
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,039
index

679
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,960
like this

680
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,000
yeah okay i think

681
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,399
all right so this should work so let's

682
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,399
check it

683
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,440
okay so come on hit me

684
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,159
come on hit me

685
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,159
come on

686
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,840
oh no of course

687
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,720
ah sorry

688
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,880
we're not checking the collision so

689
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,799
inside of this entity

690
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,000
and update so

691
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,480
after this checking tile ah okay and uh

692
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,960
i forgot another thing

693
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,919
yeah let's check object two

694
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,440
so

695
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,919
like

696
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,720
you know if there is a door then uh

697
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,399
collision should happen so

698
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,000
check

699
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,320
object

700
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,440
and object is uh yeah

701
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,240
so this and uh

702
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,840
so this is not player so

703
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
the boolean is false

704
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,880
and okay so and so let's check

705
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:51,039
player collision two

706
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,760
and yeah past this entity

707
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,000
okay so now this should work so let's

708
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,000
check

709
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,640
okay come on hit me

710
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,440
okay

711
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,440
yeah so he stopped it

712
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,760
yeah so now

713
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,799
collision is happening

714
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,440
from

715
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:24,799
both direction

716
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,679
player to npc and then pc to player

717
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,600
yeah

718
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,720
perfect

719
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,519
alright so i think that's it for now and

720
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,200
next time we will implement a dialog

721
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,279
system so

722
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,690
we can talk to him

723
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:51,440
thanks for watching and until next time

724
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:53,519
[Music]

725
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,519
you
