00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,759
hi guys this is rice no

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,599
last time we created the event handler

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,840
class so now we can trigger event

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,920
when player character

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,680
hits a certain tile

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,840
however after uploading the video i

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,119
received this comment from

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,439
terminallyunique95 so

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,400
the player character keep receiving

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,199
damage

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,640
if you keep pushing him in the same

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,960
direction and yes i was aware of this

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,640
and i thought it's somehow acceptable

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
since you can

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
avoid getting further damage if you

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,800
change your direction

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,840
and i knew handling this would require a

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,879
little reconstruction of the code so i

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,079
was kind of being lazy and took an easy

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,960
way but i have to agree it would be

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,960
definitely better if the system is more

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,439
flexible and give us more options so

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,080
thank you for pointing this out and

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,920
giving me a push to work on it

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,560
we still reuse the majority of the code

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,920
that we have written in the last video

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,159
and i think you will like the result

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
anyway let's start

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,799
okay so last time we used this rectangle

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,920
class to create the event select

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
but this time we create a new class for

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,840
this

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,200
so

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,880
inside of this main package

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,479
create a class

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,759
i'm going to name this

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,439
event

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
left

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,600
and this class

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
extends

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,280
rectangle

42
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,320
so this is basically an extended version

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
of

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,079
rectangle

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,759
it still has all the functions of

46
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,640
rectangle but we can add more

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,399
and first we create the default x and y

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,239
variables here

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,280
and select

50
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:18,800
default x and event

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,319
select default y

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,080
right

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,360
then we create a boolean

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
event

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
dom

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
call first

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
so

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,480
with this boolean we can check if this

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,400
event has already happened or

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,920
never happened yet

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,560
so this gives us an option to create on

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,040
one time only event

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,040
then go to this

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,720
event handler class

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,160
and remove this rectangle event left and

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:01,040
also this integers

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,040
and instead we use this event left

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,840
and select

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,440
as a two dimensional array

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,120
and now inside of this constructor

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,120
we instantiate this

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,239
select

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,599
equal new

74
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,959
event

75
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,840
left

76
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,040
and the size is b dot

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
max

78
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,519
fold call and gp dot

79
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
max

80
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,319
all love

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,720
so now we have an event rectangle on

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
every single tile on the map

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
basically

84
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,480
and then we're gonna set the

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,959
this solid area

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,560
to this alley

87
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,319
into call

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
equals zero

89
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,319
into now

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
zero

91
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,159
and y

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
call

93
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,799
system

94
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,640
max

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920
world call

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
and

97
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,400
lao is listen peter

98
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,000
max

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,920
world law

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and we're gonna

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,959
copy this

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,840
or cut on the paste here

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,840
and change this to

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,280
event rate call and

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,040
so

106
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,919
after this this is this

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,919
and also

108
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,840
this

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
this

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,520
call

111
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,440
law

112
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,759
call

113
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
love

114
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,680
and okay this is not a rectangle but

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
event

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,560
left

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,479
okay so now all these event elect has

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,880
this uh kind of a solid area

119
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,880
and now update

120
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,280
this heat method

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
so here's where we're gonna add

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,680
this

123
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,400
call

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,400
and the law

125
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,320
okay so event call so

126
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
let's change this

127
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,720
color on the law

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
because it's shorter

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
so

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,840
yeah we're going to add this corondell

131
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,000
to this one and this one and this one

132
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
and this is

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
called and

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,800
law

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and this is also

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
even direct

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,440
around the law

138
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,440
and this is also

139
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,400
and okay

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,280
yeah

141
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,319
okay this is it i think

142
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,840
so all the error is gone now

143
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
okay let's check

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
what

145
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,680
oh no

146
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,960
of course

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,759
stop it

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,720
yeah sorry i i forgot to

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:26,080
add call here so this loop doesn't end

150
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,120
so uh yeah let's set this if call we

151
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,360
call

152
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,520
that max

153
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,720
or call

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,319
then a

155
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,160
call call zero and low

156
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,280
prosperous

157
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
so this should end and the loop

158
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,840
let's check

159
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,039
okay

160
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,039
and okay so fit yeah

161
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:59,520
okay so it is working just like before

162
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,360
and now let's utilize the flexibility

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,360
that we acquired by creating this

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,479
event direct alley

165
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
so for example maybe you want to make

166
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,759
this

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,319
you know damage bit event one time only

168
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,400
so once you fell into the pit and

169
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,840
receive damage then

170
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
you can work on the tile after that

171
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,880
so

172
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
i will show you how to implement such

173
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,840
event

174
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,400
okay first

175
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,520
we add parameters

176
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,599
to these event methods

177
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,599
so

178
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,000
call and

179
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,000
log

180
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,160
and also

181
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,840
yeah here too so

182
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,800
27 we pass

183
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,759
the

184
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,759
call and allow data to this event method

185
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,759
2.

186
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,879
so this way we can access to a specific

187
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,120
event

188
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,360
and

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
after handling this event

190
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,080
we can call that

191
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,680
event dom boolean

192
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,199
event

193
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
left

194
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
call

195
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,520
and allow

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,560
dot event

197
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,960
done

198
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,840
call true

199
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,879
then

200
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,400
inside of this hit method we had one

201
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,400
more condition here

202
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,800
event

203
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
left

204
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,919
call

205
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,839
and allow

206
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
dot

207
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,080
event done

208
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
equal

209
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
false

210
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
so this way the event only happens when

211
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,640
the

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,640
event down boolean is false so let's

213
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,640
check

214
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,160
all right let's fall into the pit

215
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,680
okay fall into a pit

216
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,360
and now

217
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,240
yeah so the event won't happen again

218
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,920
so this damage bit event is one time

219
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,519
only now

220
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,680
yeah so this is one way to utilize this

221
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,800
event left class

222
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,399
okay then another case

223
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,240
so this time

224
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,800
the damage pit is not one time only

225
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
whenever you step on the tile you

226
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,399
receive damage

227
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,120
yeah so let's disable this for now

228
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,160
but we don't want it to happen

229
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,160
repeatedly like before

230
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,480
like this

231
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,760
okay first we create variables

232
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,600
integer

233
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,480
previous

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,560
event

235
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
x and

236
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
previous

237
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,680
event y

238
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,760
and also bull bullion

239
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,959
can touch

240
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
event

241
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,720
equal true

242
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,399
what we gonna do is we set some kind of

243
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,279
margin and make it so if an event

244
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,279
happened it won't happen again

245
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,279
until player character

246
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,600
move away from the event rectangle by

247
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,320
one tile distance

248
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,440
so this way we can prevent the event

249
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,440
from happening repeatedly

250
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,600
so

251
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760
after player character

252
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,200
hit an event

253
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,200
we record his word x and worldwide

254
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,200
previous

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,480
event x

256
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,360
equal g p dot player dot

257
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,360
old x

258
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,200
yes event y equal gp dot play

259
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,000
yeah dot

260
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
worldwide

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,640
and

262
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,000
based on

263
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,040
this information we check the distance

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,519
between player character and the last

265
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,399
event

266
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,920
check if the player

267
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,279
character

268
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,839
is more than one tile

269
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,519
away from the last event

270
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
okay uh

271
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,839
let me type first

272
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,240
i think x

273
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
distance

274
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,959
call

275
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
mass dot abs

276
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,440
gp.player dot word

277
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,959
x

278
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
minus

279
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,519
previous

280
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,839
event

281
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,839
x

282
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
and y

283
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,839
distance

284
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,920
equal

285
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,600
dot abs

286
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,320
gp dot

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,440
here dot world y

288
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,040
minus

289
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,760
previous

290
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
event y

291
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,760
then er distance

292
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,560
equal

293
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,360
mass dot max

294
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,360
x

295
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
distance

296
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,680
and y distance

297
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,839
and if

298
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,480
this turns it's

299
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,279
larger than gp dot

300
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,279
tile size

301
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
then

302
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,639
can

303
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
touch

304
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,040
event

305
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,040
equal true

306
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,040
so in case you are not familiar with

307
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
these

308
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
mass

309
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,519
methods

310
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,480
this mass abs returns absolute values of

311
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
this

312
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
this calculation

313
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
so which means even if the number is

314
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,600
negative it still gets it as a positive

315
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,399
number so

316
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,760
this is useful when you want to know the

317
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,040
pure distance between objects

318
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,639
then we use this must.max

319
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,639
so this simply picks a greater number of

320
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,720
two integers

321
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,600
so either it's horizontal or vertical

322
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,360
we take a greater one

323
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,240
and if this distance is greater than the

324
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,839
tile size then it means player character

325
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,839
is more than one tile away from the last

326
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,680
event so

327
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,399
we can trigger

328
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,279
the event again

329
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,160
and we add if statement here

330
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,240
if

331
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,480
can touch event equal

332
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
true

333
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
then we can check

334
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
this

335
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,519
event

336
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,519
and also

337
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,720
after this damage pit event

338
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,839
we add this line

339
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,040
can

340
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
touch

341
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
event

342
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,040
equal

343
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,320
parts

344
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,160
and to test this i'm gonna add one more

345
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
damage bit

346
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,120
at

347
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,120
somewhere around here

348
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,519
core 13 and

349
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,560
low

350
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,959
19

351
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,720
and this time i'm gonna set

352
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:44,320
any to this required direction

353
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,440
yeah so direction doesn't matter

354
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
okay let's check

355
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
okay

356
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,120
here four interpret

357
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,000
but now it doesn't happen repeatedly

358
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,680
like before and this one as well

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
going to pit

360
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,800
yeah

361
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,800
but you can still move move away

362
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,920
like this

363
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,880
where is it this bit here

364
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,440
yeah yeah so now once the event happens

365
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,079
it won't happen again until player

366
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,120
character takes one tile distance from

367
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,759
it

368
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,480
for this healing event

369
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,519
we don't need to move away to

370
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,839
trigger the game since we

371
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,079
we didn't add

372
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,240
this drawing to this

373
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,759
healing pool method

374
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,880
but you can choose how you handle it

375
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,880
yup that's it

376
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,759
so the event system is more flexible and

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,680
customizable now

378
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,199
and we can add

379
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,079
more element

380
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,720
to this event select class whenever we

381
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
get a new idea

382
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,680
i should have done this in the first

383
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,560
place so i apologize for making the

384
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,440
process a bit redundant

385
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,480
i hope you like this new system

386
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,240
and in the next video i will answer

387
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,320
another comment

388
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,639
and address a

389
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,160
couple bugs regarding npc introduction

390
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,920
and then we move on to the next stuff

391
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,920
thanks for watching and until next time

392
